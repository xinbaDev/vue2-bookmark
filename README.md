vue2-bookmark
=========================
A chrome bookmark extension which allow users to search bookmark based on title, url, date added.

## Why creating this extension

As the the number of bookmarks increases in chrome(1000+), it is getting difficult to find a bookmark when I need it. This is especially true when a bookmark can be categorized into different bookmark folders and it usually take quite a while for me to locate a specific bookmark. Although chrome has a built-in bookmark manager, it lacks some functionalities. These functionalities, I think, will definitely improve the bookmark searching experience. One thing I found missing is searching a bookmark by the time it added. I find it very convenient if I can serach bookmarks that I added today or during the last few days. This allows me to reflect on what I read recently. Another missing functionality is helping export the bookmarks and sharing them with others. With the help of this bookmark extension, these bookmarks can be easily exported and you can share them with my friends.

This extension is still under heavy development so please feel free to submit a pull request!
